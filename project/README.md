This project is based on a social networking website such as Facebook. Due to it's restricted functionalities we have named it as miniFB. It isn't a fully created website and lacks a lot of functionalities in comparison with the actual Facebook, we have concentrated on the security aspects of the program. I have tried to cover various security principles, prevention techniques and practicies. 

## Functionalities
a. Users can login with username/password in the database 
b. Keep the session active after the user logged in
c. Logged-in users can change their passwords 
d. Secure Session Authentication 
e. CSRF Prevention 
f. Anyone can register for a new account (username/password)
g. Logged-in users can add a new post 
h. Logged-in users can view all posts (by all users) 
i. Logged-in users can add comments in any posts 
j. Logged-in users can edit (update, delete) their own posts 
k. A user cannot edit posts of other users
